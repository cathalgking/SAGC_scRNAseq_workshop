SAGC Bioinformatics Workshop - scRNA-seq
==============================

-	Thursday 2nd November 2023
-	Room 4.50, The Braggs Building, The University of Adelaide, Victoria Drive Adelaide, SA 5005 Australia

This website contains all of the necessary content to carry out the 1 day SAGC scRNA-seq workshop.

The course is divided into 4 main parts:

      1. Introducton to scRNA-seq
      2. Primary data analysis with cellranger
      3. Downstream secondary analysis with Seurat in R
      4. Alternative scRNA-seq data structures and related methods such as Spatial Transcriptomics

There are no strict academic prerequisites for this workshop, however, those with the following experience will benefit most.

-	Basic understanding of Next generation sequencing and modern high throughput omics experiments
-	Decent working knowledge of R
